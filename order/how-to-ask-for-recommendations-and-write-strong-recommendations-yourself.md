# How to ask for recommendations and write strong recommendations yourself

### **Ask peers and previous co-workers/managers for recommendations**

First, **reach out to 2-3 of your previous and current coding partner(s) and ask them for recommendations.** LinkedIn has an "Ask for a recommendation" button that auto-fills the request for you, but you can also simply send them a message over Slack.

We also encourage you to ask for recommendations from clients, previous managers and coworkers, or (if you're a recent college graduate) professors you've had good experiences with. Again, you can use LinkedIn's "Ask for a recommendation" feature to auto-create the request for you, but we recommend writing a more personal request. If you're not sure how to request a recommendation, you can use the following template:

*Hi [Name],*

*I hope you’re doing well!*

*I’m currently moving into a software development role, so I've been updating my LinkedIn. I really valued the time that I spent working with you at [company], and I wanted to reach out to see if you’d be willing to write me a short LinkedIn recommendation.*

*I know you’re busy, so if it would make it easier, I could send you a draft recommendation that you could edit. I'd also be happy to send you any extra information that could make writing a recommendation simpler for you.*

*If you don’t feel comfortable writing a recommendation, I understand! But you had such a positive effect on me that I wanted to reach out just in case.*

*I’m looking forward to hearing from you,*

*[Your name]*

### **Give your peers a recommendation, too**

If you ask your peers (like coding partners, standup team members, or mentors) for a recommendation, you should also give them one as well. Feel free to be creative with your recommendations, but if you're struggling to write one, you can also use the template below:

[*Name of Micronaut*] is [*why they're special*]. *[Describe your professional relationship in 10-15 words],* and in that time *[explain what they've been successful at doing]*. [*List 1-2 things that the Micronaut excels at]. [List a positive personality trait and why that positive personality trait positively impacted you or the work environment]. [State that you highly recommend them].*

And here are a few examples using the template above:

*Alejandra is one of the brightest software developers I've ever met. I worked alongside her while building a two-player platformer, and in that time she proved her commitment and determination over and over again. Alejandra is always challenging herself--she's the type of person who reads documentation for fun, and her attention to detail is evident in all of the projects I've worked with her on. She's also genuinely a kind, encouraging person, and kept me from falling into bug blues multiple times. I can recommend her without reservation.*

*Moses is a fantastic software engineer, and his detail-oriented approach made him a pleasure to work with. We pair-programmed extensively together while enrolled at a software development program, and in that time his work ethic blew me away. Moses views writing clean, accessible code as a calling, and he's great at identifying areas where we can improve UI. He's also super friendly; by the time our project was done, I felt like we'd known each other for years. I can't recommend him enough!*

*Ryan is exactly the sort of software developer any company would love. I met them while struggling with a tough data structures problem, and within a few minutes they'd managed to explain a concept I'd been struggling with for days. They have a great way of simplifying complex problems into bite-sized pieces, and as a junior developer, that was really valuable for me. They're also just a fun person to chat with! If you need to get a job done simply and efficiently, Ryan's definitely the person for you.*
