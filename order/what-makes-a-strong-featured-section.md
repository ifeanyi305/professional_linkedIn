# What makes a strong Featured section?

### **What should you add to the Featured section?**

The Featured Section lets you showcase your work as a software developer, so it should include links to **your most complex, attractive projects**. However, there are also other things you can add. Here's a list of ideas:

- Your resume (add as media)
- A project walkthrough recorded on Loom or Youtube (add as a link)
- A link to your portfolio (add as a link)
- Web development articles you've posted online (add as a link)
- Development-related presentations you've given (add as media or as a link)

In this first version of your LinkedIn page, **add 3 items to this section, and at least 2 of them should be projects with links to the live demos**. 

As you move through the program and work on more projects, remember to include them here but try to limit yourself to **5-6 items**, total. But don't over do it! If necessary, replace simple projects with more complex ones.


### **How to correctly add projects to the Featured section**

To add a project to the Featured section, click the plus icon on the upper right corner. You'll be given the option to either add media, a link, posts, or articles. **For the most part, you should select either media or link--**the bullet points above explain when to use which option.

Paste the link or upload a file you'd like to add to the Featured section. Once you do so, you'll be given a preview screen containing a default image, a title, and a description. While you cannot edit the default image within LinkedIn, you **can** edit the title and description. **Feel free to copy/paste your GitHub project descriptions into the description field -** you don't have to write entirely new descriptions.

Once done, save your project. You can view the gif below for help.

### **Make sure your Featured projects have thumbnails**

If you upload a file or link to a project, LinkedIn will nearly always add a link preview/thumbnail. **However**, you may occasionally notice that some of your projects (especially live demos) **don't** have thumbnails. This is because you haven't added a link preview. Take a look at the example below.

If one of your projects **does not** have a thumbnail, **add** **link previews to the meta tags** of that project. Doing so will ensure that the thumbnail shows up properly, rather than a blank gray box that does nothing to entice a hiring manager into clicking. [Check out this great Hubspot article on how to add link previews to the meta tags](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/social/featured-image-not-displaying-correctly-in-social-preview) if you're not sure how to do so.

### **Finally, arrange your best projects first**

LinkedIn only shows the first 3 featured media as a default; viewers have to scroll to see the rest of them. Therefore, you need to make sure that your best projects come first. Click the pencil/edit icon and then click and drag your projects to fit the order that you'd like.
