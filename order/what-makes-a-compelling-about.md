# What makes a compelling "About?"

As you know, an elevator pitch is a short, persuasive introduction to who you are and your major accomplishmentsâ€”**[and you wrote one at the very beginning of your Microverse journey](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/interviewing/use-your-usp-to-craft-the-first-draft-of-your-elevator-pitch.md
)**. Its purpose to quickly show potential employers who you are and what you can do so that they're motivated to contact you. On LinkedIn, you mention this information in the "About section".

To begin writing this section, open your elevator pitch and ensure that it provides this information:
- Your background
- Preferred stack
- Education
- Personal information, such as hobbies, personal interests and goals
- At least one accomplishment or "hook" that can encourage someone to keep reading.

Then add:
- Some keywords that will help recruiters find you --check [this link](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/interview-prep/preparing-your-linkedin-for-both-keyword-searches-and-hiring-managers-with-the-skills-section.md) for some suggestions), and
- Links to your Github profile, portforlio and email address.

You can also include:
- Testimonials from peers (which you can copy/paste from your LinkedIn recommendations)
- A few major projects you've worked on (which you can copy/paste from GitHub descriptions)
- Additional accomplishments.

Finish with a **call to action** to invite recruiters, hiring managers, and others to contact you.

For an example that follows this formula, look below:

Reaady? Now take 10 minutes to update your **elevator pitch** and add any information that is missing, list out your **tech stack** and write a 1 sentence **general call to action**. Then add your text that to the "About section" following these instructions:

- [Edit the About Section in your LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a553140/edit-the-about-section-in-your-profile)

When you've done so, go through a second iteration and follow these guidelines to **format your text for a more appealing look**:
- If a sentence is longer than 3 lines, break it up and put a space in between
- Check for any typo's (with something like [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/browser/chrome))
- Add useful links to work you've done


Try to aim for something like the examples mentioned above!
