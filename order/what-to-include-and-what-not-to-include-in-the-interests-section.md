# Whom to follow (and whom to avoid following) in LinkedIn

You can follow as many companies, group or professionals as you'd like in LinkedIn, and they will be added to your Interests section. We recommend using this list as a starting point:

- Companies or software developers you admire
- Organizations whose missions you find valuable
- Remote-oriented groups
- Groups aimed at those in your specific city, country, or continent
- Groups aimed at development concepts you'd like to learn more about
- Groups aimed at your specific stack

Think about companies that you admire or industries you're especially excited about joining, and then start following those companies, influencers, and groups so they are included in your Intersts list.

### **Is there anything I shouldn't add to Interests list?**

Although the Interest section is mostly personal and unique to you, it's best to remember that LinkedIn is a **professional networking site**, and that **any hiring manager can view your LinkedIn Interests**. If you add interests that are inappropriate or not safe for work, or that may be acceptable in some countries but illegal in others, you risk losing out on job opportunities (or potentially getting blacklisted from some jobs entirely).

We also recommend you avoid following organizations or groups that can make you seem more "junior" than you are; if you join a group called "Junior Software Developers," you risk potential employers thinking that you don't know enough to qualify for a position.

Pick whom to follow wisely, and try to focus only on those that you think could have a positive effect on your career path.
