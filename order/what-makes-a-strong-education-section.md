# What makes a strong Education section?

To complete your Education section, open up your resume and **start copy-pasting** each education entry into LinkedIn (in the same **reverse-chronological order**). Be sure to review each entry to make sure that you haven't introduced copy/paste errors or formatting mistakes. Remember to include graduation dates for each entry. Since you are currently completing the Microverse program, register your expected graduation date instead.

There are also a few additional things to keep in mind that are Education-specific. Let's discuss them below:

1. The Education Section has **two** long-text options: an entry for Activities and Societies, and an entry for a **Description**. Your resume bullet points belong in the **Description,** **not** the Activities and Societies section.
2. The Activities and Societies field is used primarily for things like clubs or extracurricular organizations (things like robotics club, debate team, intramural football, etc). For example, if you were a Microverse mentor, you can add "Student Mentor" in the Activities and Societies field of the Microverse entry.
3. This is optional, but we recommend adding links. LinkedIn allows you to add media to each individual experience. Feel free to upload your certificates here, or link to any projects you're especially proud of (even if you already added them to the Featured section).

Again, if you'd like to add additional education entries, feel free to do so. However, like we mentioned previously, **if you want to add more entries**, [you must return to the resume module
](create-the-first-draft-of-your-resume.md) to review writing achievements-focused bullet points. Failure to do so will likely result in your LinkedIn going through multiple reviews.
