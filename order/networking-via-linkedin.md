# Networking via LinkedIn

Once you've identified companies, influencers, or groups to follow, start interacting with their LinkedIn posts. [Take some time to review the Professional Skills lessons on how to network well, which you will find linked here](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/community/what-is-networking-and-why-is-it-important.md), and then use your learnings to start conversations with devs, hiring managers, and anyone else you think would be rewarding to talk to. As you do, always keep in mind that the purpose of networking is to build relationships and friendships; networking is a habit, not a one-time action.
