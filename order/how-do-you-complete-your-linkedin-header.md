# How do you complete your LinkedIn header?

### **Update your URL**

Firstly, make sure that you’ve updated the default LinkedIn URL to a professional, personalized one (preferably using some combination of your first, middle, and/or last names). You can edit this easily by navigating to your profile page and clicking “Edit public profile & URL.” If you're not sure how to do so, (or why it’s important) watch the following video:

### **Add a cover photo**

Adding a cover photo to your LinkedIn is a quick, simple way to personalize your profile, and one that Microverse **strongly recommends.** You can use anything from a stock photo of code to a high-quality image of your hometown to a custom-made banner--as long as the photo is professional and **high-quality** (not grainy or blurred), feel free to inject a bit of your personality. If you're not sure what type of cover photo to use, please read Austin Belcak's [great article on how to choose (or create) a fantastic cover photo](https://cultivatedculture.com/linkedin-cover-photo/) for some excellent advice.

To update your cover photo, click the pencil icon in the upper right corner of the default photo. You can see an example below.

### **Upload a professional profile photo**

You should already have taken a professional photo in an earlier lesson of this module; upload that photo to your LinkedIn profile.

**Wherever possible**, you should use the same professional photo on various social media profiles, including GitHub, LinkedIn, and Wellfound; this will help you build your personal brand as a software developer, and will make it easier for recruiters to identify you.

If you're not sure how to upload your photo, use the gif below as an example.

### **Add your headline**

**\*Note:** to edit your headline, click the pencil icon in the upper right corner of your Intro block. The gif above shows you how to access it.\*

As a default, LinkedIn provides you with an automatic headline: [your current job title] at [your current place of work]. Unfortunately, however, that default headline isn't keyword optimized, and (because it's the default), most software developer profiles on LinkedIn will have nearly identical headlines. The good news is that even small changes to your headline will help you with keyword optimization and standing out.

A strong headline should contain at least two (and preferably all three) of the following elements:

- Your **job title** (required)
- **Keywords** (required)
- Your **USP or Unique Selling Proposition** (required)
- A **metric, goal,** or **accomplishment** (strongly preferred)

Your **job title** will be something like "Software Engineer" or "Web Developer." Your **keywords** can include your specific tech stack, major tools you've worked with, or the type of development you focus on. Your USP should highlight a quality or skill that distinguishes you. And **metrics**, like always, are something cool you've accomplished.

Here are a few examples you can use as models while creating your own headline:

_Software Engineer | Development, Design, & Architecture | Building Click-and-Drag Kanban Tools with Redux_

_Full-Stack Web Developer. JavaScript, Rails, React, Redux. Improving open-source projects, one commit at a time_

_Software Developer & Web Designer. I help startups take their products from concept to launch. Need help? Contact me below._

_Software Engineer. In love with pair-programming, JavaScript, and remote work._

Two things to keep in mind:

- **Don't** use up space on mentioning that you're currently looking for a job. You can indicate that elsewhere on your profile (which we'll discuss momentarily), and the space could be better used for keywords or metrics.
- If you include your stack, don't include HTML or CSS; if you're a developer, it's expected that you'll know HTML and CSS. Use the space for more worthwhile keywords.

### **Add your education to the Intro block**

**\*Note:** to edit your education, click the pencil icon in the upper right corner of your Intro block. The gif above shows you how to access it.\*

Your education may already be listed in your Intro block, but if not, add it. You can do so by clicking the "Edit Intro" pencil icon and then checking the _"Show education in my intro"_ checkbox.

As a default, LinkedIn will showcase your latest education experience (which for most students will be Microverse). If you have a degree from university, however, you might instead prefer to list your university instead. **Either choice is fine**, so long as you list one of them.

If you would like to change the education entry that shows up, click the drop down in the edit box and select the entry you would like to choose. See the image below for an example.

### **Add your contact information**

At the very least, your contact information must include the following:

1. Your email address
2. A link to your GitHub
3. A link to your portfolio

You may add other links as well (for example links to your Medium, professional Twitter, etc.), but these three links are essential.

❗️**Important note:** Verify that your visibillity settings will display your email to reviewers and recruiters -- people that may not be your close contacts. Follow these steps:
- Click on your profile at the upper right corner.
- Select "Privacy and setting".
- Click on "Visibility".
- Select "Who can see or download my email".
- Set email visibility to "Anyone on Linkedin".

### **Let recruiters know that you're open to work**

The last step to creating your Intro block is to let recruiters know that you're looking for a job. There are **2 ways** to communicate you are open to potential outreach in your LinkedIn profile:

1. Click the **Open to** button beneath your profile photo and select **Finding a new job**. Once you click those buttons, a pop up will appear containing the job titles you're open to.
- Add **five related job titles** (see the photo below for examples).
- Click the **I'm open to remote work** checkbox.

2. You can also display a banner "Open to work" in your profile photo. Follow these steps:

- Click on your profile photo.
- Click on "Frames".
- Select the "Open to work" frame and click "Apply"

## Remove the "People also viewed" box from your profile

Finally, you can disable the box that shows some of the other profiles that viewers have looked while searching on LinkedIn. This prevents showing recruiters other candidates with similar profiles as yours --that is, your competition. Follow these instructions:
