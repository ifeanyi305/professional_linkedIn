# How can you showcase volunteer experiences on LinkedIn?

### **How to add volunteer experience to LinkedIn**

The Volunteer section isn't one of LinkedIn's defaults: you'll need to add it manually. To add a Volunteer section, click the "Add profile section" button in your Intro block, click "Additional," and then click "Add volunteer experience." The image below shows an example.

If you included your volunteer experience in your resume, **copy/paste that into the Volunteer section in the "description"** field.

If you did not include your volunteer experience in your resume but would like to do so in your LinkedIn profile, then **please return once more to the [resume curriculum](https://github.com/microverseinc/curriculum-professional-skills/blob/main/interview-prep/create-the-first-draft-of-your-resume.md) to review writing accomplishment-focused bullet points**. Again, this is an important step; every bullet point on your LinkedIn should be focused on showing how cool you are, and your project reviewer will return your project to you if it seems like you were just writing volunteer duties instead of accomplishments.
