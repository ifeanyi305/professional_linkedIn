# Selecting what to include in the projects section

One of the Additional sections that you can add to your Linkedin profile is the **Projects section**.

### **What should you include in the Projects section?**

The Projects section is exactly what it sounds like: a section where you can showcase projects meant to display your dev skills. The Projects section is an expanded version of the Featured section: while your Featured section should focus on a few projects you feel are especially strong, your Projects section can showcase **any project you're proud of or that fully displays your development skills**.

Pick **at least 1 project** that you think is particularly strong. **Do not choose HTML clones**; by now, you've created much more complex projects. You can choose projects you already listed in the Featured section. **We strongly encourage you to add 1-2 additional projects if possible**. Remember, the purpose of a LinkedIn is to attract recruiters and hiring managers; you'll attract them better if you show off a range of projects.

**For each project, make sure you complete at least these three fields:**

1. **Project Name.**
2. **Project URL** (link to the GitHub repo. If no repo exists, link to the live demo)
3. **Description**. **Copy/paste** this description from GitHub.

We encourage you to also fill in other fields, like dates and additional creators, but at a minimum you must include these three fields per project.
